The Driver Partner acknowledges and agrees that any loss or liability incurred as a result of the Driver’s error, miscalculation or inaccuracy in calculating or entering the amounts shall be at the Driver’s own risk and the Driver further agrees that Etapath shall bear no liability for errors, loss or liability which the Driver may incur as a result of such actions.</Text>

                <Text>6.6                             Fare adjustment.</Text>

                <Text>Etapath reserves the right to: (i) adjust the Fare for a particular instance of Transportation Services (e.g. the Driver took an inefficient route, the Driver failed to properly end a particular instance of Transportation Services in the Driver Profile, technical error in the Etapath Services, etc.); or (ii) cancel the Fare for a particular instance of Transportation Services (e.g. a Client is charged for Transportation Services that were not provided, in the event of a Client complaint, fraud, etc.). Etapath’s decision to reduce or cancel the Fare in any such manner shall be exercised in a reasonable manner.</Text>

                <Text>In consideration of Etapath’s provision of the Etapath Services, the Driver agrees to pay Etapath a service fee on a per Transportation Services transaction basis. Unless regulations applicable to the Driver’s Territory require otherwise, taxes will be calculated and charged on the Fare, and Etapath shall calculate the Service Fee based on the Fare inclusive of such taxes.</Text>

                <Text>6.7.2                                          Taxes on the Service Fee.</Text>

                <Text>Taxes may be payable on the Service Fee and/or any other fees charged by Etapath. Etapath shall calculate and remit such taxes where required by applicable law or regulation. The Service Fee and/or any other fees charged by Etapath shall be net of withholding tax and any other applicable taxes. Unless regulations in the Driver’s Territory require otherwise, Driver agrees to be responsible for withholding taxes and other applicable taxes in relation to the Service Fee. Where required by applicable law or regulations, Etapath shall calculate and remit any such taxes.</Text>

                <Text>6.7.3                                          Changes to Service Fee.</Text>

                <Text>Etapath reserves the right to change the Service Fee at any time in Etapath’s discretion based upon local market factors, and Etapath will provide notice to the Driver in the event of such change.

                <Text>Etapath agrees to report to the Driver, all collections (including Fares and Gratuities) performed by Etapath in respect of Transportation Services provided by the Driver.</Text>

                <Text>6.9                             Driver negative balance.</Text>

                <Text>Where the Driver payout is negative such that there are insufficient funds from Fares to pay the Driver associated with the Transportation Services provided by the Driver, Etapath shall record the shortfall against the Driver’s Etapath account which shall be carried forward until the Driver has repaid such amounts. Etapath may make collection options available to the Driver (e.g. cash collection kiosks, bank transfer, debit card acceptance, and mobile wallets) in order to facilitate the repayment of any amounts owed to Etapath. The Driver acknowledges and agrees that it shall bear the cost of any fees related to repayment (e.g. fees for overdraft, top-up, currency exchange, cross-border, bank transfer, or any other similar fee, charge, or expense) and any taxes (including withholding taxes, indirect taxes and VAT), grossing up amounts owed to Etapath accordingly so Etapath receives the full amount owed.</Text>

                <Text>6.10                          No waiver.</Text>

                <Text>For the avoidance of doubt, Etapath shall not be deemed to have waived its right to any amounts owed for provision of the Etapath Services if: (a) there are insufficient Fares to set off against; (b) the Driver Partner does not repay in a timely manner any amounts owed to Etapath on a weekly basis as required; or (c) Etapath elects to require a minimum amount owed prior to initiating collection efforts or otherwise delays collecting amounts owed by the Driver.</Text>

                <Text>6.11                          Suspension of Driver Profile.</Text>

                <Text>Etapath reserves the right to suspend the Driver’s Driver Profile account if the Driver maintains a negative balance for more than 1 (one) week. With each payment statement, Etapath shall report any offsetting and deductions. Etapath reserves the right to apply interest to any funds that remain outstanding for an extended period of time and/or assess a reactivation fee and/or assess any other fee allowed under applicable law in connection with fees that remain due and outstanding to Etapath for the Etapath Services past their due date. Any such interest or fees shall be exclusive of the repayment and settlement of all principal payments owed to Etapath for the Etapath Services.</Text>

In the event that a User cancels an accepted request for Transportation Services, Etapath may charge the Users a cancellation fee on behalf of the Driver. If charged, this cancellation fee shall be deemed the Fare for the cancelled Transportation Services for the purpose of remittance to the Driver hereunder ("Cancellation Fee").</Text>

                <Text>6.12.2                                       The Parties acknowledge that and agree that the Cancellation Fee is a recommended amount, which acts as the default amount. The Driver shall always have the right to: (a) charge a cancellation fee that is less than the Cancellation Fee; or (b) negotiate, at the Driver’s request, a cancellation fee that is lower than the Cancellation Fee.</Text>

                <Text>6.13                          Receipts.</Text>

                <Text>As part of the Etapath Services, Etapath provides the Driver with a system for the delivery of receipts or a bookings record to Clients for Transportation Services rendered. Upon completion of Transportation Services for Users, the receipt or booking record will be prepared and recorded on the Client’s bookings page or sent to the Client in a format requested by the Client. Receipts or booking records are also provided via email or the online portal available to the Driver on the Etapath Services. Receipts include the breakdown of amounts charged to the Client for Transportation Services and may include specific information about the Driver, including the Driver’s name and photo, as well as a map of the route taken by the Driver. Any corrections to a Client’s receipt for Transportation Services must be submitted to Etapath in writing within three (3) business days after the completion of such Transportation Services. Absent such a notice, Etapath shall not be liable for any mistakes in or corrections to the receipt or for recalculation or disbursement of the Fare.</Text>

                <Text>6.14                          No additional amounts.</Text>

                <Text>The Driver acknowledges and agrees that, for the mutual benefit of the Parties, through advertising and marketing, Etapath may seek to attract new Clients to Etapath. The Driver acknowledges and agrees such advertising or marketing does not entitle the Driver to any additional monetary amounts beyond the amounts expressly set forth in this Agreement.</Text>

                <Text>7               Additional undertakings</Text>

                <Text>7.1                              The Driver acknowledges and agrees that the Driver shall comply with, and bear sole responsibility for, all of the obligations under tax and social security laws applicable in the Territory to him or her.</Text>

                <Text>7.2                              The Parties also acknowledge and agree that at no time, and under no circumstance, shall Etapath be liable for the payment, settlement, and/or obligation to pay and/or settle any tax or social security liabilities owed by the Driver to any authority under applicable laws and regulations.</Text>

                <Text>7.3                              The Driver shall provide banking details to Etapath for the purpose of receiving payment for the completed Transportation Services.</Text>
